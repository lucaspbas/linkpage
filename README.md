Add links to your Instagram posts with your own personal LinkPage feed! Include your LinkPage link in your Instagram bio to allow followers to further interact with your posts and find more information that you attach to them.

***Instagram's current API will be deprecated on June 29th, 2020 and this code and website will then be legacy code. I will most likely not update it beyond that point.***
